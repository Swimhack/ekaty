# eKaty.com Deployment Fixes - Critical Routing Issues Resolved

## Problem Summary
The production site at ekaty.com was experiencing critical routing issues:
- `/restaurants` route returned 404 errors
- Other React Router routes were failing
- Production deployment was misconfigured

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was a **deployment configuration mismatch**:
1. **Application**: Vite React SPA using React Router
2. **Deployment**: Configured for Next.js with server-side rendering
3. **Missing SPA Routing**: Nginx configuration lacked `try_files` directive for client-side routing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Configuration
**File**: `/Dockerfile`

**Before**: Configured for Next.js deployment
```dockerfile
# Used Next.js specific build commands
RUN npm run build
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**After**: Configured for Vite React SPA
```dockerfile
# Use Vite build command
RUN npm run build
# Serve with nginx for static files
FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### 2. Created Proper nginx Configuration
**File**: `/nginx-spa.conf`

**Critical Addition**: SPA routing support
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

This ensures that all routes (like `/restaurants`) serve the main `index.html` file, allowing React Router to handle the routing client-side.

### 3. Updated Environment Variables
**File**: `.env.production`

**Fixed**: Environment variable prefixes
- Changed from `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` to `VITE_*`
- Properly configured for Vite build system

### 4. Updated Docker Compose
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`

**Fixed**: Container configuration
- Removed Next.js specific settings
- Updated health checks for nginx
- Corrected port mapping (80 instead of 3000)

## Key Technical Details

### SPA Routing Problem
Single Page Applications (SPAs) handle routing client-side. When a user visits `/restaurants` directly:

1. **Without proper config**: Server looks for `/restaurants/index.html` → 404 error
2. **With proper config**: Server serves `/index.html` → React Router handles `/restaurants`

### The `try_files` Directive
```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
```
This nginx directive:
1. First tries to serve the exact file (`$uri`)
2. Then tries to serve as directory (`$uri/`)  
3. Finally falls back to `/index.html` (SPA entry point)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/nginx-spa.conf` - SPA-specific nginx configuration
- `/nginx-production.conf` - Production-ready nginx setup
- `.env.production` - Production environment variables
- `/deploy-spa.sh` - Deployment script with testing
- `/DEPLOYMENT-FIXES.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `/Dockerfile` - Complete rewrite for Vite SPA
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Updated for nginx-based serving

## Testing the Fixes

Run the deployment script to test locally:
```bash
./deploy-spa.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the Vite application
2. Create Docker image with proper nginx config
3. Test all routes (/, /restaurants, /about)
4. Confirm SPA routing is working

## Production Deployment

1. **Build and push Docker image**:
```bash
docker build -t your-registry/ekaty-spa:latest .
docker push your-registry/ekaty-spa:latest
```

2. **Deploy with docker-compose**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Verify routes work**:
- https://ekaty.com/
- https://ekaty.com/restaurants
- https://ekaty.com/about

## Impact
✅ Fixed `/restaurants` route 404 errors
✅ Fixed all React Router routes
✅ Proper static file serving with caching
✅ Production-ready nginx configuration
✅ Correct environment variable handling

The site should now work correctly with all client-side routes functioning as expected.
